    "Visualize a surreal dreamscape where gravity is defiedâ€”objects levitate, melt, "
    "and morph mid-air. "
    "Employ highly realistic lighting techniques, including global illumination, "
    "soft shadows, rim lighting, and bounce lighting. "
    "Incorporate ultra-detailed textures that mimic real-world materials such as "
    "glass, metal, skin (with pores), liquid, and fabric. "
    "Use an extreme and dramatic camera angle, such as a wide-angle lens or top-down "
    "drone perspective, to enhance cinematic depth. "
    "Apply vivid but natural color grading, similar to footage from a full-frame DSLR "
    "camera with a 35mm lens at f/1.4 during golden hour. "
    "Add cinematic depth of field, motion blur, and high-fidelity rendering of "
    "microscopic surface details (e.g., scratches, reflections, fibers). "
    "Exclude all textual elements; all narrative context must be conveyed visually "
    "through grounded yet surreal realism."
